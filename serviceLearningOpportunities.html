                    The HS Robotics Team is looking for volunteers to help label and 
                    organize the robotics equipment storage. This job requires 
                    volunteers with an attention to detail and initiative to help 
                    find the best organizational structure. It will also require 
                    creativity to find unique solutions to the storage challenges faced.
